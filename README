WHAT IS THIS?

WWW::Search::Nomade - backend class for searching with nomade.fr

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

You need the following modules : WWW::Search

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains 
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file

When you install WWW::Search::Nomade, the MakeMaker program 
will automatically install the manual pages for you

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
